# bounded parallelism

The MD5All implementation in parallel.go starts a new goroutine for each file. In a directory with many large files, this may allocate more memory than is available on the machine.

We can limit these allocations by bounding the number of files read in parallel. In bounded.go, we do this by creating a fixed number of goroutines for reading files. Our pipeline now has three stages: walk the tree, read and digest the files, and collect the digests.

The first stage, walkFiles, emits the paths of regular files in the tree:

```go
func walkFiles(done <-chan struct{}, root string) (<-chan string, <-chan error) {
    paths := make(chan string)
    errc := make(chan error, 1)
    go func() {
        // Close the paths channel after Walk returns.
        defer close(paths)
        // No select needed for this send, since errc is buffered.
        errc <- filepath.Walk(root, func(path string, info os.FileInfo, err error) error {
            if err != nil {
                return err
            }
            if !info.Mode().IsRegular() {
                return nil
            }
            select {
            case paths <- path:
            case <-done:
                return errors.New("walk canceled")
            }
            return nil
        })
    }()
    return paths, errc
}
```

The middle stage starts a fixed number of digester goroutines that receive file names from paths and send results on channel c:

```go
func digester(done <-chan struct{}, paths <-chan string, c chan<- result) {
    for path := range paths {
        data, err := ioutil.ReadFile(path)
        select {
        case c <- result{path, md5.Sum(data), err}:
        case <-done:
            return
        }
    }
}
```

Unlike our previous examples, digester does not close its output channel, as multiple goroutines are sending on a shared channel. Instead, code in MD5All arranges for the channel to be closed when all the digesters are done:

```go
    // Start a fixed number of goroutines to read and digest files.
    c := make(chan result)
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    const numDigesters = 20
    wg.Add(numDigesters)
    for i := 0; i < numDigesters; i++ {
        go func() {
            digester(done, paths, c)
            wg.Done()
        }()
    }
    go func() {
        wg.Wait()
        close(c)
    }()
```

We could instead have each digester create and return its own output channel, but then we would need additional goroutines to fan-in the results.

The final stage receives all the results from c then checks the error from errc. This check cannot happen any earlier, since before this point, walkFiles may block sending values downstream:

```go
    m := make(map[string][md5.Size]byte)
    for r := range c {
        if r.err != nil {
            return nil, r.err
        }
        m[r.path] = r.sum
    }
    // Check whether the Walk failed.
    if err := <-errc; err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    return m, nil
}
```
